This paper explores a digitalized population dataset on daily public transportation and COVID contagion in Santiago de Chile, the capital city of one of the most unequal countries in the world. It particularly shows how low-income municipalities systematically bore the cost of the COVID pandemic. Our analyses show that (1) contagion thresholds to restrict mobility in low-income municipalities were higher and (2) lockdown policies during daytime were systematically ignored by local authorities but heavily enforced during nighttime (curfew). These findings go in line with the recent ``politics of weakness'' literature. In fact, this paper shows how local authorities faced high political pressures to systematically ignore overseeing public transportation. We use hazard models, synthetic control methods and regression discontinuity design methods.
